# Horiseon Refactor

## Goals

POV - Horiseon 

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Improvements

Added header, footer, section, and nav tags.

Added alt attributes to all images.

Made the headings appear in sequential order.

Added a descriptive title.

Clicking "Horiseon" in the navigation menu sends you back to the main page of the website.

Clicking "Search Engine Optimization" in the navigation menu links you to that section on the page.

Removed redundant code from "style.css".

Removed unnecessary class attributes. 

Applied consistent formatting to "index.html".

Added comments to both "index.html" and "style.css" to make reading the code easier.

Organized the CSS rules in "style.css".
